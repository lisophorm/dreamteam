                <![CDATA[Dawson moved to Hull City on 16th May 2003 on a free transfer from Scunthorpe United. During his several years at the Club, he has worn the captain's armband on many occasions.

Dawson is renowned for his long-range shots, particularly from free-kicks. 
He is a traditional left-back and when playing, wears all-black boots and old-fashioned white sock tie.]]>

          <![CDATA[Koren joined Hull City in 2010 signing a two-year contract and quickly became known for his long-range shooting. 

Such a key player for the Tigers in 2011/12, there was much delight when, after a summer of speculation, Robert put pen to paper on a new two-year in 2012 as the Club won automatic promotion to the Barclays Premier League.]]>

Following him to the KC Stadium was Spurs team-mate Jake Livermore on a season-long loan. Huddlestone made his debut on the first day of the 2013/14 season]]>
