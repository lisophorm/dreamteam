                <![CDATA[Dawson moved to Hull City on 16th May 2003 on a free transfer from Scunthorpe United. During his several years at the Club, he has worn the captain's armband on many occasions.

Dawson is renowned for his long-range shots, particularly from free-kicks. 
He is a traditional left-back and when playing, wears all-black boots and old-fashioned white sock tie.]]>

Such a key player for the Tigers in 2011/12, there was much delight when, after a summer of speculation, Robert put pen to paper on a new two-year in 2012 as the Club won automatic promotion to the Barclays Premier League.]]>

Following him to the KC Stadium was Spurs team-mate Jake Livermore on a season-long loan. Huddlestone made his debut on the first day of the 2013/14 season]]>

                <description><![CDATA[The KC stadium, located in Kingston upon Hull and run by the local council, is the home to newly promoted team Hull City. The council sold part of its stake in the stadium to Kingston Communications (KC) whose sponsorship provided the stadium with it’s name. The KC stadium is also the home ground to professional rugby league team Hull FC. The Stadium is truly multi-functional: not only is the KC stadium home to two sporting teams, there has also been several live music concerts at the stadium with artists such as Sir Elton John, The Who and JLS performing there.]]></description>
