            <description><![CDATA[Bale arrived at White Hart Lane as a 17-year-old left-back from Southampton and had become one of the best players in the game when he left for a world-record transfer to join Real Madrid in August, 2013. Powerful, pacy and with a demon of a left foot, the Welsh international developed his game at Spurs, scoring some outstanding goals, leading to him winning the PFA Young Player and Players’ Player of the Year, and the FWA Footballer of the Year in the 2012/2013 campaign.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Defoe joined Spurs in January, 2004, scoring on his debut against Portsmouth and regularly finding the target. He left for Pompey but returned after one season in January, 2009, and once again was frequently on the score sheet for Spurs, his natural goal scoring ability always coming to the fore. Defoe became only the third player to score five goals in one Barclays Premier League match against Wigan Athletic in 2009, and is now the fifth highest goalscorer in Tottenham Hotspur’s history with 139 goals in all competitions.]]></description>

The respect and fondness Tottenham Hotspur fans have for Ginola was shown when he was given one of the biggest cheers on their 125th anniversary when the Club’s legends were paraded on the pitch. Ginola was inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 11 December 2008.]]></description>

King made his debut in May, 1999, at Anfield, the start of a 13-year career which saw him develop into one of the best defenders of his generation, despite being hindered by a knee injury. King was forced to retire through that injury at the end of the 2011/2012 campaign but will always be fondly remembered as a true great at Spurs.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[White Hart Lane was originally a disused nursery owned by the brewery Charringtons and located behind a public house on Tottenham High Road (the actual White Hart Lane lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance).
The profits from the 1921 FA Cup win were used to build a covered terrace at the Paxton Road end and the Park Lane end was built at a cost of over £3,000 two years later. This increased the grounds capacity to around 58,000 with room for 40,000 under cover. The East Stand (Worcester Avenue) was finished in 1934 and this increased capacity to around 80,000 spectators but cost £60,000. Since White Hart lane became an all-seater stadium, the capacity had to be reduced to 36,310.]]></description>
