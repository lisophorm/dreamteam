            <description><![CDATA[Scott Parker joined West Ham United from Newcastle United for £7 million in June 2007. After recovering from a knee injury, Parker went on to become a modern-day Hammers hero, scooping the prestigious Hammer of the Year award in three consecutive years from 2009 to 2011. A Barclays Premier League title winner with Chelsea in 2004/05, Parker’s all-action style and habit of scoring important and spectacular goals endeared him to the Boleyn Ground faithful. The midfielder’s form saw him earn an England recall in February 2011. Later the same year, he completed the 2010/11 season by being voted Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[An enigmatic Italian forward, Paolo Di Canio will forever be afforded hero status in East London following an unforgettable three-and-a-half year spell with West Ham United. The passionate Rome-born player had won titles in his home country before moving to British football with Celtic in 1996. Di Canio moved to the Boleyn Ground in January 1999, helping the Hammers to finish a record high of fifth in the Barclays Premier League five months later. In March 2000, Di Canio volleyed in the Barclays Premier League’s Goal of the Decade at home to Wimbledon. After being voted Hammer of the Year in 2000, he was given a FIFA Fair Play award for catching the ball when Everton goalkeeper Paul Gerrard was injured.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A strong centre forward blessed with fine technical ability and the ability to finish with either foot, Dean Ashton emerged as one of English football’s most-promising strikers at Crewe Alexandra. After a year with Norwich City, Ashton joined West Ham United for £7m in January 2006, with his goals helping the Hammers to reach the FA Cup final five months later. An England call-up followed in August 2006, only for the forward to suffer a broken ankle that would eventually end his career three years later. Despite his relatively short stay at the Boleyn Ground, Ashton is held in the highest esteem by West Ham fans.]]></description>

The stocky Argentina forward arrived in a blaze of publicity after the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals and lived up to his reputation by scoring seven goals to help keep the Hammers in the Barclays Premier League. He left for Manchester United in summer 2007, going on to win two Barclays Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League, before winning the title again with Manchester City. The three-time South American Footballer of the Year is now with Italian giants Juventus.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Relentlessly popular among West Ham United supporters, Joe Cole was lauded as one of the most skilful English players in decades when he emerged in the late 1990s. On joining Chelsea in 2003, he won ten trophies, including three Barclays Premier League titles and three FA Cups, while also playing in the 2008 UEFA Champions League defeat by Manchester United. An England regular for many years, Cole has travelled to four major tournaments and been capped more than 50 times by his country. He returned to the Boleyn Ground to a hero’s welcome in January 2013.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[West Ham United moved into the Boleyn Ground in 1904, having previously held home matches at Hermit Road, Canning Town and the Memorial Grounds in the club’s early years.
The stadium was badly damaged during the Second World War, when a German V-1 flying bomb landed on the south-west corner of the pitch in August 1944, causing the club to play away matches for the next three months.
The Boleyn Ground was extensively redeveloped in the late 20th century, when the North, South and West Stands were all renovated.
The Hammers will leave the Boleyn Ground after 112 years in summer 2016, when the club will take up a new home at the London 2012 Olympic Stadium in nearby Stratford.]]></description>
