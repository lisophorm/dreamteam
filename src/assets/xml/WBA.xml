            <description><![CDATA[West Brom have been playing at The Hawthorns for more than 100 years.\r\nThe stadium was the first Football League ground to be built in the 20th Century and was opened on September 3, 1900, with construction work lasting just four months.\r\nThe ground was built on the old Hawthorns Estate, and hawthorn bushes had been grown there in the past, so the name was especially appropriate.
At 168 metres, The Hawthorns is the highest ground above sea level in the Football League.
The largest recorded attendance at The Hawthorns was 64,815 on March 6, 1937, when Albion hosted Arsenal in an FA Cup quarter-final.  
The Astle Gates pay tribute to club legend, Jeff ‘The King’ Astle, who died in January 2002. Astle scored in every round of the club’s 1968 FA Cup triumph, including the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Everton at Wembley.]]></description>
