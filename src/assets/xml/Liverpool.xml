Barnes then went on scoring and in the 1990/91 season scored 16 league goals for Liverpool.
The Liverpool fans adoration for "Digger" (he was nicknamed after the character Digger Barnes in the American soap Dallas) was emphasised when he finished in the top 5 of the poll: 100 Players ‘Who Shook The Kop’, which was conducted by the fans in the summer of 2006.]]>

Suárez made his Liverpool debut on 2nd February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2–0 win.

                <description><![CDATA[Anfield is one of the oldest stadiums in the Barclays Premier League after being opened in 1884. Although once the home of bitter rivals Everton FC, after Everton moved to Goodison Park in 1892, newly formed Liverpool secured it as their permanent home. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. With the loudest fans in the League, Liverpool use the great fan support in Anfield to their advantage in their games. Liverpool were undefeated at Anfield in 7 separate seasons, the last of which being the 2008/2009 season.
