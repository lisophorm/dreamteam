                <![CDATA[Fierce, uncompromising and destructive, Duncan Ferguson was one of a kind.
On his day, he would simply bully teams into submission, calling on his brute strength and determination to win to dismantle even the most respected defence’s.
His undying affection for Everton – and a blatant lack of it for any of his opponents – won the hearts and minds of the Goodison Park faithful, who to this day revere the striker as one of the Club’s all-time greats. Even a short-lived switch to Newcastle United in 1999 couldn’t diminish Ferguson’s status as he went on to make 273 appearances for the Merseyside outfit before retiring in May 2006.  After a spell out of the game and living abroad, Ferguson returned to Everton in October 2011 to take up his current position as a youth-team coach.]]>

          <![CDATA[In his pomp, Neville Southall was regarded by many as the greatest goalkeeper on the planet. Boasting shot-stopping nous and agility that belied his broad frame, the Welshman was named in the PFA Team of the Year on four successive occasions as he kept goal throughout the most trophy-laden era in Everton’s history. In total, he won five major honors with the Blues – two League Championships, two FA Cups and the Club’s only continental title, the 1985 European Cup Winners’ Cup. Such was Southall’s affiliation with Everton that Llandudno-born glovesman remained at Goodison Park beyond his 39th birthday, finally calling time on a 17-year Toffees career in 1998. His record of 751 appearances remains a Club record, as is his tally of 269 clean sheets]]>

          <![CDATA[Standing at just 5ft 10ins tall, Australia's Tim Cahill was an unlikely aerial menace.
Yet, that's exactly what the Sydney-born attacking midfielder proved to be during his time in the Barclays Premier League - an eight-year spell spent entirely with Everton. Signed from Millwall in 2004 following his heroics in firing the Lions to a surprise FA Cup final, Cahill went on to score 68 goals in 280 outings for the Toffees - most notably netting five against Liverpool to establish himself as the Club's leading post-war league scorer against their arch rivals.
Internationally, Cahill hit global heights in 2006 when he became the first Australian to net at a World Cup finals and remains a key figure for the Socceroos to this day.
Having left Everton in July 2012, the 33-year-old now applies his trade with New York Red Bulls in America’s MLS.]]>

          <![CDATA[Signed from Wigan Athletic in 2007, Leighton Baines has gone on to establish himself as a mainstay of Everton's first team and one of the leading left-backs in the world game.
Equally dependable both in defense and attack, the Liverpool-born defender is also renowned for his lethal set-piece prowess, highlighted by an astonishing 100 per cent Barclays Premier League penalty success rate and two stunning free-kick goals against West Ham United early in the 2013/14 campaign.
Part of the Wigan team which earned promotion to the top flight in 2004/05, Baines has been voted Everton's Player of the Season three times since making the switch to Goodison Park, earning a spot in the PFA Team of the Year in 2011/12 and 2012/13.
On the international scene, Baines has also been a long-time rival for Chelsea star Ashley Cole since making his England debut in a friendly against Egypt in March 2010.]]>

          <![CDATA[Everton Academy product Wayne Rooney burst on to the scene in October 2002, beating legendary Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman aged just 16 to net an unforgettable winner and end the champions’ 30-match unbeaten run.
A boyhood Blue, Rooney had already bagged his first senior goals in a League Cup win over Wrexham earlier that campaign, at the time becoming Everton’s youngest ever scorer.
His continued good form caught the eyes of the world and following his goal scoring heroics for England at Euro 2004, the 18-year-old was sold to Manchester United for £25.6million - the highest fee ever paid for teenager.
Rooney departed Goodison Park having netted a haul of 17 goals in just 77 games for the Toffees, proving his billing as one of the most exciting prospects the country had ever produced.  
Already Manchester United's leading goal scorer of the Premier League era, Rooney is rapidly closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time club record of 249.]]>
