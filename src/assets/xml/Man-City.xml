                <![CDATA[In the summer of 2008, at the age of 22, Vincent signed from Hamburg and joined Barclays Premier League side Manchester City for approximately £6 million.

At the end of 2010/11, then team manager Roberto Mancini praised Kompany's "incredible" season and claimed that with his attitude and mentality, Kompany can become one of the best defenders in Europe.

Kompany was included in the Barclays Premier League Team of the Year two years in a row in 2011 and 2012 and won the Premier League Player of the season in 2012.]]>

                <![CDATA[Having scored 103 goals in 189 games, Shaun Goater became an iconic figure over the course of his five-year association with the Club and can be considered one of greatest goalscorers to ever wear the sky blue shirt.

Some 13 years later, Shaun is also arguably one of the club’s most influential players in recent history, thanks to his goals which helped to fire City back into the big time after years spent in the abyss.

These qualities and his commitment to raising footballing standards across the board in his home country earned Shaun an MBE for services to sport and young people in 2003.
Therefore, it’s no surprise that this popularity extends to his homeland, too - Bermuda’s most famous son was toasted with the first "Shaun Goater Day" after he was awarded the freedom of the island on 21 June 2000.

“Feed the Goat and he will score…” was his chant, still heard from time-to-time in the Etihad Stadium.]]>

In the 94’ FA cup match against Notts County Uwe scored four goals, becoming the first Manchester City player to score four in an FA Cup tie since Johnny Hart in 1953. His performances that season meant he was the Club's leading goalscorer, and went on to win the Club's Player of the Year award.]]>

Silva began the 2011/12 season in fine form, scoring the third goal in City's 4–0 thrashing of Swansea City and was voted man of the match. On 17th September 2012, Silva signed a new five-year deal at Manchester City, committing himself to the Etihad Stadium until 2017. He finished the 12/13’ season with four goals and ten assists in 32 League appearances for City.]]>
